# Soft Skills Puzzle-eLitmus
### Live on (https://treasurehunt-npui.onrender.com/)

Welcome to the Soft Skills Puzzle, an interactive game designed to assess users' soft skills, such as attention to detail, perseverance, and curiosity. Users must solve a series of clues to progress through the game and reach the final treasure. The game is hosted on a cloud-based website and can be accessed from any internet-connected device.

## Tech Stack

Our game is built using the following technologies:

- React.js/Bootstrap for website structuring and styling
- JavaScript for creating interactive elements, such as clues and animations
- Node.js for server-side scripting and handling user data
- Express.js for creating a RESTful API to handle user authentication and data storage
- MongoDB for storing user data and progress

## Game Features

Our game includes the following features:

- User authentication using email addresses
- A minimum of 5 clues to solve to reach the final treasure
- Dead-ends that require users to backtrack and try different paths
- A requirement to find the final clue that leads to the treasure
- Progress tracking of time taken for each step and solution accuracy
- The ability to save progress and resume later
- An admin dashboard for tracking and analyzing user progress

## Deployment

Our game is deployed on a cloud-hosted website, such as GitHub.io or Netlify, to ensure accessibility and ease of use for users. To deploy the game locally, users will need to install Node.js and MongoDB, clone the repository, and run the commands "npm install" and "npm start" to start the server and access the game website at https://treasurehunt-npui.onrender.com/.
